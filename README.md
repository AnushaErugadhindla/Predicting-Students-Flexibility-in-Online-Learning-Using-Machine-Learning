# 🎓 Predicting Students’ Flexibility in Online Learning Using Machine Learning

## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the **flexibility of students in online learning environments** using **machine learning techniques**. The goal is to understand how students adapt to virtual education and to identify the factors that influence their flexibility and success in online learning.

The findings from this project can help educators design personalized strategies to support students with lower adaptability, thereby improving overall learning outcomes.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Environment:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries & Tools:**  
  - `pandas`, `numpy` — Data handling and preprocessing  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` — Data visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` — Machine learning model development

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and normalized numeric features.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Conducted visual and statistical analysis to uncover key trends and correlations.  
3. **Model Building**  
   - Implemented and compared multiple machine learning algorithms:  
     - Decision Tree (selected as the best-performing model)  
     - Random Forest  
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix, and Cross-Validation.  
5. **Model Saving**  
   - Saved the final model (Decision Tree) using `joblib` for future predictions.
